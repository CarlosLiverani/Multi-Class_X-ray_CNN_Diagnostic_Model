# multi-class-disease-classification-on-Chest-X-rays
In this project! We will explore medical image diagnosis by building a state-of-the-art chest X-ray classifier using Keras.

The assignment will walk through some of the steps of building and evaluating this deep learning classifier model. In particular, we will:

Pre-process and prepare a real-world X-ray dataset
Use transfer learning to retrain a DenseNet model for X-ray image classification
Learn a technique to handle class imbalance
Measure diagnostic performance by computing the AUC (Area Under the Curve) for the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve
Visualize model activity using GradCAMs
